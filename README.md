# Repository Pattern Project in Console

This repository contains a C# console application demonstrating the Repository Pattern as a design pattern. The project showcases how to use this pattern to manage data access and persistence effectively. Data is stored and managed using XML files, providing a practical example of data handling and repository design in a console application.

## Features

- **Repository Pattern**: Implements the Repository Pattern to abstract data access and promote separation of concerns.
- **XML Data Storage**: Uses XML files to store and manage application data.
- **Console Interface**: Provides a simple console-based interface for interacting with the application.
- **Data Management**: Includes functionalities for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Programming language used for application development.
- **Repository Pattern**: Design pattern for abstracting data access logic.
- **XML**: Data storage format used for persistence.
- **.NET Framework**: Platform used for developing and running the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with support for C# and .NET Framework

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChowdhuryMunir/RepositoryPatternProject_InConsole.git
   cd RepositoryPatternProject_InConsole
   ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. **Build the Project**
   - Build the project in Visual Studio to restore NuGet packages and compile the application.

4. **Run the Application**
   - Start the application using Visual Studio. It will run in the console window.

## Project Structure

- **Models**: Contains classes representing the data entities used in the application.
- **Repositories**: Implements the repository interfaces and classes for managing data access and manipulation.
- **Data**: XML files used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Program.cs**: Entry point of the console application, handling user interactions and invoking repository methods.

## Application Features

- **Create**: Adds new records to the XML data file.
- **Read**: Retrieves and displays records from the XML data file.
- **Update**: Modifies existing records in the XML data file.
- **Delete**: Removes records from the XML data file.

## Usage

Run the application from the console to perform CRUD operations on the data. Follow the prompts in the console to interact with the application and manage records.
